                    A saree is a story in itself for it has existed for more than 5000 years. This six to nine yards of absolute wonder and beauty doesn't need an introduction. It is a story of how women have adorned it gracefully; passed it down from generation to generation as a symbol of timeless beauty. A beautiful saree is an everlasting piece of art. It holds within itself the history of skilled craftsmen, of strong women who made it a symbol of sheer grit and strength, of memories that were experienced in them.

                    A saree is considered to be amongst one of the oldest forms of garments in the world, its first-ever mention dates back to the Vedas and some records from the Indus Valley Civilization. One can find draped garments of Indian sculptures in the Rig Veda, as it translates to 'a strip of cloth' in Sanskrit. It is believed that this unstitched piece of cloth was draped around the body but was quite different from what we see today.

                    But maybe the greatest influence on the saree came when the British arrived in India. Even at that time, the Indian women wore 6 yards of cloth around their body without any blouse or petticoat. It was during those days when this way of wearing a saree with a blouse was popularised and is still worn today.

                    In fact, sarees in India are influenced by various cultures. The way it is draped, weaved, and its colors used have all evolved over centuries. This started when the art of stitching, weaving, printing, and several other methods emerged. Traditionally the sarees were made of cotton or silk only but slowly every other region of our country developed its own method from the Nauvari saree of Maharashtra to the Banarasi silk saree of Varanasi. They differ in material, patterns, and designs along with the weaves used to create them.

                    The popularity of a saree has a great deal to do with its versatility. A saree is such a garment that can be worn in a thousand different ways and still look ever beautiful and elegant. It holds a different meaning to every woman in their lives. For some, it's their identity, in their traditions and culture, or maybe for some, it is simply a family choice. It allows the wearer to style it to look formal, traditional, or casual. The drape styles are dynamic and vary according to the geographic location and their cultural identity.

                    But, we stare in awe for the versatility a saree holds and remains conventional as well as contemporary at the same time. This unstitched garment has evolved drastically and has seen a fascinating transformation over the years but what remains beautiful is that women from all walks of life tell their own story for the choice of saree they wear. Being worn by millions of women every day is what makes a saree a great storyteller - something that is ever eternal and timeless.
